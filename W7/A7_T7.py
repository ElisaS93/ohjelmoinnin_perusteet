# Implement Enigma machine in Python.

# The program must handle:

# 3 x Rotors with 26 positions (A-Z)
# 1 x Reflector - Types A, B & C
# 0 x Plugboard. Prompt is required, but no need to implement.
# The order of machine operations described:

# User presses letter on the keyboard
# Keypress is passed via plugboard (skipped in this exercise)
# Rotate the wheels (positions)
# Scramble current letter using “Forward pass-through” process
# Iterate through rotors in order 1-3
# Create offset using current rotor position and the letter
# Use the offset to shift the given letter in alphabets
# Scramble current letter using using the reflector
# Scramble current letter using “Reverse pass-through” process
# Iterate through rotors in reverse order
# Change current letter based on each wheel position offset
# In this program, user inserts row and the scrambling starts always from positions [0, 0, 0]. So enter press means that the program must reset the positions before scrambling the inserted text. The Enigma machine will shut down if the user enters an empty line.

# Recommended datastructures:

# Rotors(characters): list[str]
# Positions(rotor positions): list[int]
# Reflector: str
